##jQuery Mega Man

This is a simple exercise using jQuery to animate the video game character, Mega Man.

When you hover over Mega Man, Mega Man starts running. Hovering out of Mega Man makes him stop running. Clicking on Mega Man makes him shoot his gun.

This is achieved very easily by using jQuery and `hide();` or `show();` on certain page events like `mouseleave`, `mousedown` or `mouseup`.
